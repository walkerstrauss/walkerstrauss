I am a senior undergraduate student at Cornell University graduating in May 2025 with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Game Design. I am currently working as a research assistant in both the Affect and Cognition Lab (ACLAB) and Meta Design Lab at Cornell, where I have equipped myself with MRI data analysis and iterative product design methodologies. I am also project lead for Mahsjong, a 1v1 strategy-based game being developed in C++ with a team of eight, and have experience with user-centered interactive web design in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
